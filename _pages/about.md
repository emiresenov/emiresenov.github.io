I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology. My research focuses on machine learning with applications in high voltage engineering.

Previously, I was a master's student in data science at Uppsala University, specializing in machine learning and statistics. I did my master's thesis at the Division of Solar Cell Technology where I developed automation and machine learning methods for a self-driving magnetron sputtering lab. 

My undergraduate studies took place in my hometown, Lule√•, where I studied computer engineering. 

Research interests include solving novel and interdisciplinary problems using machine learning. If you are interested in collaborating, or simply getting in touch, don't hesitate to reach out!
